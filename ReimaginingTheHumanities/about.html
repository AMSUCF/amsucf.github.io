  <p><b>This site serves as the Digital Compendium for the <a href="https://parlorpress.com/products/reimagining-the-humanities">full volume, available via Parlor Press</a></b></p>
  <p>While most of the works included in the book are essays intended for print, several of the works are fully born-digital and are introduced and discussed in the print volume but presented here fully online, taking advantage of the platforms available to us for scholarly making, while others include augmentations and additional resources demonstrating the digital practices and thinking engaged within the text. The volume thus engages with questions and challenges of activist pedagogy, theoretical and methodological rethinking, institutional and administrative shifts, and applied, "maker"-driven work. These reflections are situated in practice, with scholars reflecting on their training and preparation for the work they are engaged in now and scholars pointing toward the need for more engaged self-evaluation in the work they hope to do in the future.

    <h3 class="cardfont">Preface to <i><a href="https://parlorpress.com/products/reimagining-the-humanities">Reimagining the Humanities</i></a></h2>
    <p>This volume was started prior to the pandemic, with a call that circulated at a different (but perhaps no less dire) moment for
the humanities: we first circulated the call to authors in September 2018 and envisioned a relatively traditional collection in form. First drafts were completed prior to the start of the pandemic, and so many of these chapters were conceptualized at a moment before what would so often be called an "“"unprecedented" moment, and shifted with their authors through the process (and inevitable delays) of the pandemic's transformation of the university and society at large.</p>
<p>The impact of the last several years is evident across humanities publishing. Peer review timelines are shifting; volunteer labor is difficult to find in the face of collective overwork and burnout; editors are facing both supply chain and production challenges along with their own cuts and labor fatigue; and authors are working under the pressures of contingent positions, decreased staff support, and increased care-taking challenges made worse by university funding cuts and political scrutiny. This volume was transformed by these challenges, and we particularly regret the loss of some voices among our contributors as a result of changes in their own lives that made it impossible to continue – we note that this impact is felt most strongly among those already marginalized in higher education, and thus is a loss not just for the collection but for the humanities at large.</p>
<p>There are also changes in the volume that reflect shifts in our collective
understanding of the importance of hybrid work: the conversation
around digital scholarship, as reflected so strongly by the work of venues
pushing the boundaries such as <i>Kairos: A Journal of Rhetoric, Technology, and Pedagogy; Textshop Experiments; Hyperrhiz</i>; and <i>The Digital
Review</i>, has been ongoing since before the pandemic, but demands renewed
attention at a moment when so much of our scholarly endeavor
has been transformed by technology. This volume is a partial (and as
such preliminary) response to those shifts, and thus includes a supplemental
digital component that exists on the web. The works included
in this section reflect a range of voices, from experienced to relatively
new creators of digital scholarship, and are documented in the print
edition through abstracts pointing towards the full online versions of
the works. We hope these serve as a model for continuing to think
about the form and function of our work as humanists, though we
note that while the work included was built to endure on web-based
technologies, some of it may prove ephemeral with the shifts in platforms
and structures that lie ahead.</p>
