<h2>Project Description:</h2>
<p>
    Monstrous Weathered is a screen-based hypertextual adaptation of the <a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/?hl=en#!forum/monstrous-weather-netprov">Monstrous Weather netprov</a>. According to Rebei (2004), “rereading, understood as a second, subsequent reading to a first reading will, through the new interpretations that it produces, add to the known textual meanings and thus open the possibilities for rewriting” (40). Part of my intention in rewriting the netprov as a hypertext was to recapture something of the proto-hypertextual interconnectedness that I felt when originally reading the various fragments of the networked performance as they were posted, while at the same time look for some way to balance the exploratory nature of hypertext with the movement towards a conclusion and closure that emerged in the final few posts in the performance. As Hutcheon (2006) suggests, the fundamental appeal of adaptation “comes simply from repetition with variation, from the comfort of ritual combined with the piquancy of surprise. Recognition and remembrance are part of the pleasure (and risk) … so too is change” (4). This desire for both comfort and surprise can be seen in my adaptation of the netprov in the form of a hypertext, an attempt to recapture a moment of community in the midst of these climates of change.
