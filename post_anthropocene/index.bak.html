          <h2>About the Work</h2>
          <p>In this piece, a grammar system (created by the artists with Tracery, Kate Compton's tool for 
            generative text structures) uses identified “gendered” terminology to generate short poetic works. 
            These short texts have been curated by the artists and then used as input for a text-to-art AI to generate 
            fantastical paintings. Supporting Safiya Noble's claims in <i>Algorithms of Oppression</i> and the many 
            critiques of AI bias that have raised similar concerns, the work invites viewers into a better understanding 
            of machine learning through creative visualization, these pieces are able to create visualizations of the 
            systemic gender representations and biases embedded within the data and code.</p>
          <p>The exhibit consists of two elements: the poetic Tracery generator, which runs in the browser live to 
            create new poetics as shown above; and the pre-generated illustrated poems, which cycle through demonstrating 
            the visualization of the post-anthropocene poetics using Disco Diffusion, which builds on human creativity and 
            thus inevitably "dreams" through a gendered lens. These generated imagines demonstrate how the visual rhetorics 
            of existing work are embedded into every iteration of our machine learning co-creation, as choices as seemingly 
            netural as landscape or portrait are loaded in their influence on the outcome.</p>
