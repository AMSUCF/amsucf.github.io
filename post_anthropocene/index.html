          <h2>Artists' Statement</h2>

          <p>In this piece, we critically reflect on societal gender representations and biases that are embedded within
            the data sets and AI code that are presented as nuetral agents. We created a poetry generator which uses 
            identified "gendered" terminology[1] to generate short poetic works, drawing on existing encoded binaries and underlying assumptions that the algorithm magnifies. 
            These short texts have been curated by the artists and then used as input for a text-to-art AI to generate 
            fantastical paintings. Supporting Safiya Noble's claims in <i>Algorithms of Oppression</i>[2] and the many 
            critiques of AI bias that have raised similar concerns, the work invites viewers into a better understanding 
            of machine learning through creative visualization, these pieces are able to create visualizations of the 
            systemic gender representations and biases embedded within the data and code.</p>
          <p>The piece consists of two elements: the poetic <a href="https://www.tracery.io/">Tracery</a>[3] generator, 
            which runs in the browser live to 
            create new poetics <a href="grammar.html">here</a>; and the pre-generated illustrated poems, 
            which cycle through demonstrating the visualization of the post-anthropocene poetics (as seen above) using 
            <a href="https://colab.research.google.com/github/alembics/disco-diffusion/blob/main/Disco_Diffusion.ipynb">Disco Diffusion</a>[4], 
            which builds on human creativity and 
            thus inevitably "dreams" through a gendered lens. These generated imagines demonstrate how the visual rhetorics 
            of existing work are embedded into every iteration of our machine learning co-creation, as choices as seemingly 
            netural as landscape or portrait are loaded in their influence on the outcome.</p>
