        "Making masks started out of necessity: every excursion out of the house, from getting groceries to picking up takeout, felt safer with even a few layers of fabric between me and everyone else. I started sending them to friends, especially those in cities and other spaces where social distancing is more difficult. The first ones were miserably uncomfortable (thanks to the elastic shortage, I cut up waistband elastic to make the bands or made long straps from bias tape), but eventually they got better.", "I started working with Orlando Face Mask Strong to donate to local medical services and teachers sent back to the classroom. We worked with donated kits, cut by teams with laser cutters in bulk, first from shopping bags and later from layers of flour sack fabric donated by Rifle Paper Co. Eventually, as schools reopened, we started receiving more requests for kids masks. They are alarmingly small.", "As the call for donations slowed down, I started making more masks for events: the Electronic Literature Organization virtual conference's lead volunteers and keynote speakers and my new cohort of Texts & Technology PhD students received homemade masks in the mail instead of swag. I'm still making them, more slowly now, and it's hard to imagine there will be a time when we can stop.", "Holidays are the hardest. Halloween is a giant party in Orlando, and we watched as everything was cancelled: the film-inspired festivities of Halloween Horror Nights; the costumed bash of Mickey's Not-So-Scary Halloween Party, and so forth.

        , "Like PDF sewing patterns obtained on the internet, PPE patterns demonstrated through websites, YouTube videos, Pinterest boards, and more are all digital media. With the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, these patterns have cropped up alongside ads for masks from start-ups looking to sell completed PPE to the public. My mask pattern was an adaptation from a YouTube video sent by a professor, but because I did not have elastics or pipe cleaners, I used ribbon or hair elastics and twist ties, something I was only able to do because I had been taught how to sew prior. At the same time that these mask patterns started coming up, advertisements for purchasing complete masks began appearing on many different social media feeds. PPE is now ubiquitous with the pandemic, both patterns and disease spread from our remediated world obsessed with globalised online structures erasing the very mediums that help their propagation. At the same time, both stem from things humanity believed to be relegated to the past: home sewing and virus spread. This situation has embedded digital media further into history while simultaneously remediating home activities."
        , "My partner John and I jumped straight into making masks as soon as public health indicated their necessity. We wanted to make sure our friends and family and the larger community were covered. It seemed like a natural shift from sewing and making as a hobby (cosplay) to making masks. The process was time consuming but John worked out the kinks in our patterning process on trial masks. We ultimately settled on the curved style with a layer of heavy interfacing between the inner and outer layers, with pipe cleaners to provide nose support, and offered folks tie or over-the-ear straps."
        , "[My partner John and I] dug out all of the fun fabric we had squirrelled away for to-be-made-someday projects; it was nice to focus our energy on helping early in the pandemic when our province was enforcing the 'stay the blazes home' order. We refused payment because we wanted to see people protecting each other and themselves and we were wary of the infodemic spreading misinformation about masks. We made close to 120 masks all told using our 1940s Singer sewing machine. John patterned, we split the labour of sewing, and I did all of the finishings (straps and nose pieces)."

        , "My mother is a skilled seamstress who owns a sewing machine and so she helped me greatly during the making process. She made many of my outfits herself when I was young. Leftover fabrics were tucked away in the basement (because 'waste not, want not'), which have finally found purpose again after two decades in storage. It is strange to see patterns that I affiliated with happy moments from my childhood repeated on a textile shield from disease ... In total, we made 32 masks. Two of the masks were given to my mother's co-worker, who donated elastics to us when we couldn't find them on our own. Three masks were mailed to Newfoundland as a thank-you to my roommate who gave me some fabrics to use before she moved back home. One was given to my grandmother and a few others were kept for my immediate family, to do our part in preventing the transmission of COVID-19 when we go out for essentials, but also just for peace of mind while we brace the risks that come with being in public now. The rest of the masks were given to someone in my neighbourhood whom I met through local events. She works in long-term care and needed PPE while supplies are short"
        , "This project gave me purpose for a few days and allowed me to engage with a catastrophe that has seemed too cripplingly large and complicated to tackle alone. Making PPE has given me an opportunity to connect with my family, by collaborating with my mother using a skill she possesses which I have always taken for granted, and my community, by giving back in the small ways that I can to those who have helped me or need help themselves."
        , "[Mask making] is a good opportunity for me to practice my sewing skills, which are somewhat mediocre, as well as spend some time with my mom. She initially oriented me with her sewing machine and now, after surviving a messy prototype, I am a little bird flying on my own in the big world."
        , "Getting into a groove with sewing is kind of fun and it makes me wonder why I don't do it more often. There are probably tons of patterns online for that cool shirt or skirt or whatever that I can never find in a store.  It makes you appreciate how much skill it takes to create something that seems simple but can be quite complex. It also brings to mind the monetary value that we exchange for products--particularly as it relates to the costs of labor."
        , "My grandmother, a professional seamstress, had taught me the essentials of sewing when I was a little girl. She passed away when I was 11, but one of my fondest memories of her was when she would give me lessons on sewing buttons and mending small tears. My grandmother taught herself how to sew professionally during WW2 and made a career out of it, as a home-economics teacher in Kiev, Ukraine, and as a seamstress. She began sewing out of necessity, out of demand both civic and financial. My mother did not pick up sewing till her hands started shaking, and she was restricted to the home much more, thus needing an activity to help regain control of her motor skills and to occupy her time. I like to think that the skill was in me, and that I had the basic skill, which was easy enough to acquire to make masks in a dire situation. It would be interesting to think about manual labour in times of distress, what are the means of production that increase?"
        , "The first mask took me around 3 hours to make; I was working slowly, making sure to follow instructions diligently, while also leaving room for trial and error. I had gotten the wrong kind of elastic at first, which was impossible to stitch in and would have been uncomfortable to wear. I used shoelaces for my first mask instead which worked perfectly. Stitching the folds proved to be a challenge as well, since the mini-mender could not fit layered fabric, which is why I had to resort to hand-stitching for this step ... The first mask was effective, and I kept it as my personal mask. The other masks I made took much less time; it took a total of 30 minutes per mask, with the steps of stitching the elastics in properly and stitching over the folds being the trickiest and most time consuming, given the equipment I was using. I used J Cloths as filters, and gave 5 extra cloths with each mask I gave away. I distributed masks to my roommates, friends, and family. I plan on donating masks to my residence as well, to essential workers in the buildings as well as offering them to any and all residents who would like one. I had talked to my classmate, Kem, about household items that could be used for making masks, and got excited about that; however, as my resources were limited since I have only been in Canada for 8 months and don't have a lot of old clothing to use, and with not a lot of stores being open, I could not go to a thrift shop, I resorted to Walmart and Dollarama for my fabric, thread, and other sources."
        , "On a personal note, the making of the masks, and sewing, proved to be a therapeutic practice in times of severe distress and anxiety. I can't do much to change the situation around me, my usual coping mechanisms which include going outdoors and changing my setting are not feasible right now or in the same way. Sewing and handwork in general proved to be a great relief, where for an hour or two a day I wasn't thinking and stressing but focused on the activity at hand."
        , "After spending a few days making masks, learning how to sew, pricking my fingers with needles, and getting into arguments with my sewing machine, I really began to enjoy this exercise, and appreciate all of the efforts seamstresses, as well as my relatives, spend into making beautiful things that I take for granted. However, this exercise was not without a few challenges beyond simply mastering the skill or technique. In fact, it came with challenges that I did not expect. First, there were issues relating to the accessibility of materials due to varying factors, including manufacturing issues caused by a pandemic, and my current living situation (in my parent's house in Whitby, Ontario). Second, there were issues with trying to get my masks accepted somewhere for donation. It seemed that most places in my hometown either already had a relatively healthy supply of medical-grade, disposable masks, or they simply refused to accept homemade materials. Both of these issues will be explored in greater detail in this reflection, though it does beg the question as to what it is that causes these issues. In some ways, the first one may be explained by simple manufacturing issues being short on supplies because every manufacturer seems to be short on everything. However, part of me wondered if much of this has to do with the 'pandemic rhetoric' in the media impacting consumer responses that cause shortages. This rhetoric may also explain the cause of having my mask donations rejected by so many different places and people. Overall, the experience gave me an interesting look into maker culture while also seeing how 'pandemic rhetoric' in the media makes its way into everyday life and its impact on such seemingly unrelated things."
        , "Getting some of the materials was surprisingly difficult, making the project somewhat inaccessible . I had fabric from my mother, who had more than enough fabric to spare. She also had a sewing machine, which made the mask making process extremely easy. I was even able to get my hands on a vacuum cleaner bag since my father had some stored away. What I was desperate for was the elastics, which were incredibly difficult and took almost two weeks to get my hands on. I first tried to place an order through Amazon, which ended up giving me an estimated delivery date of mid-May. I then began calling every store in my hometown that I could think of that might sell it, only to be told time and time again that they were out of stock. I had tried to use old shoelaces in the interim, but, as a novice sewer, I could not figure out how they would work with the mask tutorial I was using."
